@article{Brown_Park_Warford_Seiffert_Kawamura_Lappin_Kunda_2018, title={SpatioTemporal Template-based Search: An Architecture to Model Human Search for Spatiotemporal Targets}, abstractNote={Visual search for a spatiotemporal target occurs frequently in human experience—from military or aviation staff monitoring complex displays of multiple moving objects to daycare teachers monitoring a group of children on a playground for risky behaviors. In spatiotemporal search, unlike more traditional visual search tasks, the target cannot be identiﬁed from a single frame of visual experience; as the target is a spatiotemporal pattern that unfolds over time, detection of the target must also integrate information over time. We propose a new computational cognitive architecture used to model and understand human visual attention in the speciﬁc context of visual search for a spatiotemporal target. Results from a previous human participant study found that humans show interesting attentional capacity limitations in this type of search task. Our architecture, called the SpatioTemporal Template-based Search (STTS) architecture, solves the same search task from the study using a wide variety of parameterized models that each represent a different cognitive theory of visual attention from the psychological literature. We present results from initial computational experiments using STTS as a ﬁrst step towards understanding the computational nature of attentional bottlenecks in this type of search task, and we discuss how continued STTS experiments will help determine which theoretical models best explain the capacity limitations shown by humans. We expect that results from this research will help reﬁne the design of visual information displays to help human operators perform difﬁcult, real-world monitoring tasks.}, author={Brown, Ellis and Park, Soobeen and Warford, Noel and Seiffert, Adriane and Kawamura, Kazuhiko and Lappin, Joseph and Kunda, Maithilee}, year={2018}, pages={18} }
@article{Redmiles_Warford_Jayanti_Koneru_Kross_Morales_Stevens_Mazurek_2020, title={A Comprehensive Quality Evaluation of Security and Privacy Advice on the Web}, abstractNote={End users learn defensive security behaviors from a variety of channels, including a plethora of security advice given in online articles. A great deal of eﬀort is devoted to getting users to follow this advice. Surprisingly then, little is known about the quality of this advice: Is it comprehensible? Is it actionable? Is it eﬀective? To answer these questions, we ﬁrst conduct a large-scale, user-driven measurement study to identify 374 unique recommended behaviors contained within 1,264 documents of online security and privacy advice. Second, we develop and validate measurement approaches for evaluating the quality – comprehensibility, perceived actionability, and perceived eﬃcacy – of security advice. Third, we deploy these measurement approaches to evaluate the 374 unique pieces of security advice in a user-study with 1,586 users and 41 professional security experts. Our results suggest a crisis of advice prioritization. The majority of advice is perceived by the most users to be at least somewhat actionable, and somewhat comprehensible. Yet, both users and experts struggle to prioritize this advice. For example, experts perceive 89% of the hundreds of studied behaviors as being eﬀective, and identify 118 of them as being among the “top 5” things users should do, leaving end-users on their own to prioritize and take action to protect themselves.}, author={Redmiles, Elissa M and Warford, Noel and Jayanti, Amritha and Koneru, Aravind and Kross, Sean and Morales, Miraida and Stevens, Rock and Mazurek, Michelle L}, year={2020}, pages={21} }
@article{Warford_Kunda_2018, title={Measuring Individual Differences in Visual and Verbal Thinking Styles}, abstractNote={Do people have dispositions towards visual or verbal thinking styles, i.e., a tendency towards one default representational modality versus the other? The problem in trying to answer this question is that visual/verbal thinking styles are challenging to measure. Subjective, introspective measures are the most common but often show poor reliability and validity; neuroimaging studies can provide objective evidence but are intrusive and resource-intensive. In previous work, we observed that in order for a purely behavioral testing method to be able to objectively evaluate a person’s visual/verbal thinking style, 1) the task must be solvable equally well using either visual or verbal mental representations, and 2) it must offer a secondary behavioral marker, in addition to primary performance measures, that indicates which modality is being used. We collected four such tasks from the psychology literature and conducted a small pilot study with adult participants to see the extent to which visual/verbal thinking styles can be differentiated using an individual’s results on these tasks.}, author={Warford, Noel and Kunda, Maithilee}, year={2018}, pages={6} }
